## üîç Overview

This SlackBot Q&A Assistant is designed to provide intelligent responses to user questions in Slack channels. It uses a combination of LLM (Large Language Model) technology and vector search to find the most relevant answers from a knowledge base. The system includes a feedback mechanism where users can flag incorrect answers, which are then reviewed and improved through an admin dashboard.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Intelligent Q&A**: Answers questions using OpenAI's language models
- **Dual Vector Search**: Uses two FAISS indexes to search for relevant information
  - Regular index for AI-generated responses
  - Improved index for human-verified answers
- **Feedback System**: Users can flag incorrect answers with a thumbs-down reaction
- **Admin Dashboard**: Review and improve flagged answers
- **Similarity Detection**: Prevents answering previously flagged questions
- **Content Moderation**: Filters out inappropriate questions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built with a FastAPI backend that handles:

1. Slack event subscriptions
2. LLM interaction via OpenAI API
3. Vector search using FAISS
4. Database operations for flagged questions
5. Admin dashboard for content moderation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite (with SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Vector Search**: FAISS
- **LLM Provider**: OpenAI
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI Text Embedding (text-embedding-3-large)
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 Templates for admin dashboard
- **Integration**: Slack API (Events API, WebClient)

## üß† How It Works

### Question Answering Flow

1. User asks a question in a Slack channel
2. The bot receives the message via Slack Events API
3. The question is processed:
   - Checked against flagged content
   - Embeddings are generated for vector search
   - Both FAISS indexes are queried for relevant information
4. The LLM generates a response with context from:
   - Human-verified answers (prioritized)
   - AI-generated answers (fallback)
5. The response is posted back to the Slack thread

### Feedback Flow

1. User reacts with a thumbs-down to an incorrect answer
2. The system stores the question and incorrect answer in the database
3. Admin reviews the flagged question in the dashboard
4. Admin provides the correct answer
5. The corrected Q&A pair is added to the improved FAISS index for future use

## üì• Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Slack workspace with admin access
- OpenAI API key

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/slackbot-qa-assistant.git
   cd slackbot-qa-assistant
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   # OpenAI Configuration
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

   # Slack Configuration
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=
   SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=
   BOT_ID=

   # Application Configuration
   APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
   APP_PORT=8000
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

- **OpenAI Configuration**
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for accessing LLM and embedding models

- **Slack Configuration**
  - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Bot token starting with `xoxb-`
  - `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`: Used to verify requests from Slack
  - `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID`: ID of the Slack channel the bot should monitor
  - `BOT_ID`: Slack Bot ID to prevent the bot from responding to itself

- **Application Configuration**
  - `APP_HOST`: Host address to bind the server (default: 0.0.0.0)
  - `APP_PORT`: Port to run the server on (default: 8000)

### Slack App Configuration

1. Create a new Slack app at [api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Enable the following OAuth scopes:
   - `channels:history`
   - `channels:read`
   - `chat:write`
   - `reactions:read`
3. Install the app to your workspace
4. Enable Event Subscriptions:
   - Set Request URL to `https://your-server-url.com/slack/events`
   - Subscribe to the following events:
     - `message.channels`
     - `reaction_added`
5. Copy the Bot User OAuth Token and Signing Secret to your `.env` file

### Language Model Configuration

The bot uses OpenAI's language models. This is configured in `main.py`:

```python
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
llm = OpenAI()

from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(
    model="text-embedding-3-large"
)
```

You can modify the model settings or parameters as needed.

## üöÄ Usage

### Starting the Server

Run the FastAPI server:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --host ${APP_HOST} --port ${APP_PORT} --reload
```

For production, consider using Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers:

```bash
gunicorn main:app -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -w 4 --bind ${APP_HOST}:${APP_PORT}
```

### Testing the Bot

Use the following endpoints to test the bot:

- `/test_bot` - Test if the bot can post messages to Slack
- `/test_events` - Test if the events subscription is working
- `/test_event_subscription` - Test if Slack events are reaching the server

### Using the Bot in Slack

The bot will automatically respond to messages in channels it's invited to. For best results:

1. Ask direct questions
2. Use thumbs-down reactions to flag incorrect answers
3. Wait for admin review of flagged questions

## üñ•Ô∏è Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard allows you to:

1. Review flagged questions
2. Provide correct answers

Access the dashboard at: `http://your-server-url.com/dashboard`
